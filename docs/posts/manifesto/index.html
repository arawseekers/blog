<p>In getting involved, something to think about: How does one allocate the limited resources of one’s being in search for truth? Not all truths can be discovered because we are finite. And in many cases, it is subjective.</p>

<p>DO YOU REMEMBER your first few seconds, first few hours on your first job? A secret knot tightens itself in the stomach. You think this is exciting, to put forth something that you came up with, in exchange of money. What you may not have known then is that framing matters. Depending on what life one lead prior to their first (legal) employment, a job could provide a structure in one&rsquo;s life. Or it could disrupt a routine.</p>

<p>And then, the world continues to evolve, and they will continue to monitor your progress. People go up and down the ladder. Some of them run faster than you do, but you tell yourself that you will maintain a pace that will sustain a constant energy level. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about pacing,&rdquo; you mumble, looking at younger colleagues climbing faster than you.</p>

<p>Few years later, you find yourself in multiple places, jumping from job to job, hoping to find a fit somewhere along the jaunt. A vermin in search of a vehicle in which to play songs, reanimating long-ago feelings, reviving a deadening pursuit. Each commute becomes a process of self-discovery, because you choose to learn about yourself in the hours you are stuck in the daily grid lock. Perhaps, the purpose pushes off the dream back to the pits, but the area where it decays is itself shrinking. What, then?</p>

<p>Greed unknowingly becomes the motif that pushes from beneath, but it is tiring to accommodate it. So greed becomes greenwashed into a different brand. But that brand feels sketched by wobbly hands, details misplaced in spots, and because it is.</p>

<p>EXAMINED MYSELF ON a normal day. I checked out how I looked that day on its opaque surface. Nothing gazed back at me, no surprise in that. I could not have possibly forgotten the only accredited (inter)face I have, but the idea has intrigued me just now. If I, the user of this body, only had the time to be patient with how each of me works, craves, despises, there would be no time for me to be overwhelmed when something bad triggers. I&rsquo;d be prepared to fill in the hollow steps in this bolero. For now, though, there&rsquo;s no beginning for the user&rsquo;s patience, a small problem I&rsquo;m willing to forego.</p>

Lucky color: #27111A<br></p>

<p><strong>Scorpio</strong>: Instead of nicotine, try cannabis. If that's hard to come by, try Fentanyl. Or a glass of water. You should definitely just drink water.<br>

<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong>: When funding your travels, design it in such a way that you'll leave the least amount of carbon footprint. E.g.: Why don't you explore first your local neighborhood before venturing out to Antarctica?<br>

<p>WE TEND TO hold on to a fluid file that gradually, perpetually slips away from our grasp, our memory. The humbling fact that our physiology is borne out of limitations, will sponsor many an angry idea, yet I&rsquo;ll still go by my courtesy that our minds can only do so much.</p>

<p>It was a clear picture at first. But since it reacts &ndash; fades &ndash; with time, the picture becomes just a sheet, splotches indicating inaccuracy, the metadata no longer readable. The sheet resembles the existence of a feeling, but what feeling, it&rsquo;s difficult to recall.</p>

<p>(What the picture depicts: a small atrium inside a police station that functioned as a waiting area where cops lounged. Two vending machines hummed, one of them already had its lights flickering. It could all be a practical joke, you thought, as you thumped with pelvis the one with still its lights on. A burning corpse by the floor filled the air with light smoke, choking you when you shouldn&rsquo;t even be alive. Nothing is wrong, you said.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird, <em>no</em>, considering that we being emotional, social creatures, to have misplaced somewhere along the spacetime what we have felt for a particular instance. When then, do we stop rewriting a figment?</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>JUST A MINUTE past noon &ndash; come to think of it, there are plenty of pleasant smells polluting the boring air.</p>

<p>My favorite, for the longest time now, dates back to my high school days, when I used to frequent a good friend&rsquo;s house. The scent, I found out much, much later, is associated with that of a wild orchid&rsquo;s. That info is according to a liquid hand soap that triggered this smell memory. Whether this is accurate, I&rsquo;m not sure; I&rsquo;d like to find out by smelling one out there in the wild.</p>

<p>What is your favorite smell?</p>

<p><strong>Aquarius</strong>: You will be designing a better product for PWDs, because they are in it, too.<br>

<p>WHILE NOT ENTIRELY birthed from the need to catalogue every journey, this gravity between two bodies orbiting one another came to be as an agreement to force them to list as many of their thoughts  as they can, as accurate and precise as they can, sans scientific scripture backing each thesis. This might mean an epistolary bible they can look back to when, for example, dinner talks with relatives produces nothing but the droning of proverbial provincial crickets. This may or may not be the crossroads of our personal endeavors, but we are certain to inject some of our advocacy whenever we can. Whatever wall of text you chance upon here, we hope that you take the time to digest it before deciding what to do with the pulp.<code>-o)-</code></p>
