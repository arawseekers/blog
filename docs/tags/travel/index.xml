      <description>First Day, 22 Nov A short intro to a long travel to airport The day started with the perennial traffic. If you&amp;rsquo;re from Metro Manila, of course, a day of commute starts there. It&amp;rsquo;s not that we didn&amp;rsquo;t almost make it on time to the airport, it&amp;rsquo;s just that we weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting a bad traffic jam on a non-rush hour, but hey, why are we even surprised?
We did make it, though, on time - enough time, even, to have a quick lunch comprising unpalatable highway robbery airport food.</description>

      <description>Have you read Part 1?
Day 3 We ate breakfast in McDo, the one near the place we stayed in, and it didn‚Äôt serve any local variant of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s food. It&amp;rsquo;s all hamburgers, fried chicken, and sausage McNothin‚Äô. Some would say that eating at a known (read: exploitive capitalist) fast food chain, one that you also have in your country, is a disservice to the self to get to know the locals or their food, but that wasn‚Äôt our case.</description>

      <description>5W, 1H of it The last week of October 2018, Gab (Isya‚Äôs sister) and Merci (Isya‚Äôs mother) went to Taipei, Taiwan to attend Gab‚Äôs first international group exhibit. Aside from that, they took the trip as a break from their usual routines in Manila and Dumaguete.
Their five-day stay in Taipei, Taiwan did not bring any actual ‚Äúpasalubong‚Äù or take-home gifts, but they had a lot of stories and memorable experiences to share with us, me and Ohio.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, I was (un)lucky enough to be reassigned to the account that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d never going back to. Only this time around, the assignment&amp;rsquo;s scope is nationwide, as in I got to go to places in different parts of the country where there is a project. Meaning, my employer would reimburse my travel expenses as long as they&amp;rsquo;re official business trips.
This is a good time as any, for me at least, to recall these trips, knowing that travel is something I shall not be doing any time soon, until 30 Apr, according to someone.</description>
