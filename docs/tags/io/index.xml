      <description>Another excuse to binge on social media  Use of FB in daily lives Since it&amp;rsquo;s free to sign up and use its services, Facebook has been popular for many Filipinos from all walks of life. Here they get updates from friends and non-friends, from relatives, from celebrities, and even from the news. It has become its own social news aggregate. Users provide the data, such as date of birth, school last attended, the things they like or don&amp;rsquo;t like, etc.</description>

      <description>First Day, 22 Nov A short intro to a long travel to airport The day started with the perennial traffic. If you&#39;re from Metro Manila, of course, a day of commute starts there. It&#39;s not that we didn&#39;t almost make it on time to the airport, it&#39;s just that we weren&#39;t expecting a bad traffic jam on a non-rush hour, but hey, why are we even surprised?
We did make it, though, on time - enough time, even, to have a quick lunch comprising unpalatable highway robbery airport food.</description>

      <description>A staple in both landscaping and urban planning is adding a natural element in an otherwise human-made environment. Depending on the budget, it could be a fountain to provide a water element; or it could be as simple as adding plants along sidewalks. In places all over, we have seen good and bad implementations of these natural elements, but the most common perhaps is the latter &amp;mdash; plants.
Exhibit A People have concluded that this plant box (and many others) is where to place their trash.</description>

      <description>Have you read Part 1?
Day 3 We ate breakfast in McDo, the one near the place we stayed in, and it didn‚Äôt serve any local variant of Taiwan&#39;s food. It&#39;s all hamburgers, fried chicken, and sausage McNothin‚Äô. Some would say that eating at a known (read: exploitive capitalist) fast food chain, one that you also have in your country, is a disservice to the self to get to know the locals or their food, but that wasn‚Äôt our case.</description>

      <description>5W, 1H of it The last week of October 2018, Gab (Isya‚Äôs sister) and Merci (Isya‚Äôs mother) went to Taipei, Taiwan to attend Gab‚Äôs first international group exhibit. Aside from that, they took the trip as a break from their usual routines in Manila and Dumaguete.&amp;nbsp;
Their five-day stay in Taipei, Taiwan did not bring any actual ‚Äúpasalubong‚Äù or take-home gifts, but they had a lot of stories and memorable experiences to share with us, me and Ohio.</description>
