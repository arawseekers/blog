      <description>THE FACTUAL PIECES here shall be made obvious when necessary, so try to make allowances for every entry. They say that when two opposite states of matter coexist at a single point in time, it&amp;rsquo;s believed to be in superposition unless an observer finds themself literate enough of the ways to approach such nuance. Accordingly, these statements are neither true nor false until someone (you, the observer?) comes along, and formulates a theory that we can together test.</description>
