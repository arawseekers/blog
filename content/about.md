We, the Araw Seekers, are two different individuals, who one day decided to write the journey and exploration of our thoughts, musings, and actions. Published in the Internet to be archived and serve as reference in understanding and living our present. The expressions written, hopefully, may help others navigate their own future musings and adventures.

_Araw_ is the Filipino term for the Sun. 

_Seekers_ are people who seek (v.), which then means:
 
* to try to find or discover by searching or questioning 
* to try to obtain 
* to try or attempt
* to go in search or quest of 

Dedicated to those who hope, no matter how dark the night is, knowing that morning, preluded by dawn, always comes. The seekers consist of Isya and Ohio (two different individuals) who currently occupy the same space and breathes the same air.
