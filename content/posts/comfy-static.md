For years it has been a constant breakfast staple in our household the unique voice of Joe Taruc along with _kapeng barako_ and _pan de sal_. Every day I would hear the program Pangunahing Balita and Damdaming Bayan in our kitchen/dining/sala area. According to Wikipedia, these shows are the longest running public affairs program. From the time I wake up to the time I need to leave the house, the radio is tuned in to DZRH. In some occasions, it's the classical station, owned by the same owner of DZRH. The blaring radio in the morning is a reminder that our father is home and having a dose of his news; or sometimes, i wonder, his dose of background noise every morning.

Last 12 January 2020, days after welcoming the new decade we were greeted with the phreatic eruption of Taal Volcano in Batangas. Taal Volcano is known for being a volcano within a volcano or a lake within a lake. We were 110 kilometers away from the eruption site but ashfall still descended on our humble abode. The eruption had forced evacuation for all residents living in 14km danger radius because the activity inside around Taal Volcano has not subsided. Earthquakes were felt and fissures appeared around the lake. Talk about starting your year with a blast. And anything could get worse. And it would.

A few days after buying the radio, we didn’t immediately turned it on. I guess, Ohio is not a fan of morning news. I can’t blame him because all you get are bad, overly sensationalized news. So I only tune in alone. Familiarizing myself with the power, volume, and tuner knobs on the side of the plastic radio. To power, you have to turn up and clockwise the power/volume knob, while another knob is used for scanning. The speaker produces a familiar humming static. It transports me back to another place and time.  Flashes of memories and feelings are made present when the static sound permeates the surrounding. Tested if the dial was moving and scanned all the stations in A.M. and P.M.

Ang tagal ko ng dapat isunulat ito para hindi na mawala pa ang mgsa salita sa aking isip. Pero mahilig ako mag paliban, ito ay aking sakit. Malubhang sakit na walang lunas at gamut.
“There is always a way to get out of the way is to be on your way.”
